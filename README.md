##21 Savage Express App

21 Savage message board that allows users to comment, thumbs up or down, and delete comments

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js Express

There's an express server that serves up an .ejs file that is used to display
data from a Mongo database. The data contains messages and the overall thumbs
up or down count.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to edit an endpoint so that it accesses the same collection property
as another endpoint. This allowed me to keep track of overall thumbs up or down
on the server and display it with one property.
